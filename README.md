# OverLook Hotel Management

##### OverLook is a fully functioning hotel management tool for hotel staff to manage activities like customer details, booking details for different types of rooms and calculating/displaying a customerâ€™s total bill. I used a number of Object, Array, and String Prototypes to manipulate fetched data and display it cleanly on the DOM using jQuery and SASS. 

### Learning Goals

- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Separate business-logic code from view-related code
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform rich data manipulation.


### Technology Used

- jQuery
- SASS
- The Fetch API
- Webpack
- Mocha & Chai
- Chai Spies
